## 🚀 Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js 16+** and npm installed
- **Modern browser** (Chrome 141+)
- **Anthropic API key** (optional, required only for AI insights feature)

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/darshil0/micro-journal-ai.git
cd micro-journal-ai
```

### 2️⃣ Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3️⃣ Configure environment (Optional but recommended)

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
VITE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

**Get your API key:** Visit [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/) to create an account and generate an API key.

**⚠️ IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTE:** The current implementation uses direct API calls from the browser, which exposes your API key in network requests. This is suitable for personal use and development only. For production deployment, you MUST implement a backend proxy server to secure your API key and prevent unauthorized usage. See the Security section below for implementation details.

### 4️⃣ Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your app will be running at: **[http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)**

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

### Data Storage
- **100% Local**: All journal entries stored exclusively in browser Storage API
- **No Cloud Sync**: Your data never touches external servers (except AI API calls)
- **No Tracking**: Zero analytics, cookies, or user tracking
- **No Account**: No signup, login, or personal information required
- **Fallback Mode**: If Storage API is unavailable, entries are kept in session memory

### AI Insights
- **Secure HTTPS**: All API requests encrypted in transit
- **Minimal Data**: Only entry text sent for analysis, no metadata or personal information
- **Temporary**: Anthropic doesn't store API request data per their privacy policy
- **Optional Feature**: App is fully functional for journaling without AI insights
- **Environment Variables**: API key stored securely in .env file (not committed to git)

### Security Best Practices

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Production Security Requirements**

The current implementation exposes your Anthropic API key in browser network requests. This is acceptable for:
- Personal use on your own computer
- Development and testing
- Trusted local environments

For production deployment, you MUST implement a backend proxy. A secure backend proxy server (`server.js`) is included in this repository.

#### Backend Proxy Setup

1. **Navigate to backend directory** (or create one):
```bash
mkdir backend
cp server.js backend/
cd backend
```

2. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
npm install express cors dotenv
```

3. **Create .env file**:
```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
PORT=3001
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

4. **Start the proxy server**:
```bash
node server.js
```

5. **Update frontend to use proxy**: Modify the API call in `src/App.jsx`:
```javascript
// Change from direct API call to proxy
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3001/api/insights', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ entries: recentEntries })
});
```

### Additional Security Recommendations
- For sensitive journals, use browser private/incognito mode
- Storage API data persists until manually cleared (browser settings → Clear browsing data)
- Suitable for regulated environments (HIPAA, GDPR) with proper deployment configuration
- Regular backups recommended (export feature coming soon)
- Never commit `.env` file to version control
- Use rate limiting on backend proxy to prevent abuse
- Implement request validation and sanitization

## 🧩 Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable                 | Required | Default | Description |
| ------------------------ | -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| `VITE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Optional | None    | Your Anthropic API key for AI insights feature |

**Without API Key**: The app works perfectly for journaling and mood tracking, but the AI Insights feature will show an error when attempting to generate insights.

**Setting up your API Key:**
1. Visit [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. Create an account or sign in
3. Navigate to API Keys section
4. Generate a new API key
5. Copy the key to your `.env` file

### Tailwind Configuration

The app uses a custom turquoise/teal color scheme defined in `tailwind.config.js`. To modify colors:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        'teal': {
          // Custom teal shades
          600: '#0d9488', // Primary buttons
          700: '#0f766e', // Hover states
        },
        'cyan': {
          // Custom cyan shades for gradients
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Custom Scrollbar

The app includes a custom-styled scrollbar (see `src/index.css`) matching the teal theme. Works in WebKit-based browsers (Chrome, Safari, Edge).
